# Boyer-Moore-Vote-Algorithm-with-Visualization
This introduces the implementation of the Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm to find the most repeated character in a string. The algorithm is efficient, with a time complexity of O(n). Additionally, the PR includes a visualization of the algorithm using Python's Matplotlib library
